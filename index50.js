// Question 1
// You are a network designer entrusted with the responsibility of designing a computer network for a small office. 
// The office consists of multiple rooms, and your goal is to connect them using the least amount of cable, ensuring that each room is connected to the network. 
// You need to analyze the office layout, identify the rooms, and plan the most efficient way to connect them with cables. 
// The objective is to minimize the required cable length while ensuring every room is connected to the network.

// Your task is to apply Prim's graph-based algorithm, which starts with an initial room and progressively adds neighboring rooms with the shortest cable connections. 
// By iteratively expanding the network, you will create a minimum-cost spanning tree that connects all the rooms in the office. 
// Take on the role of the network designer, employ Prim's algorithm, and determine the minimum cost of connecting all the rooms in the office using the provided scenario.

// Sample Input:- new Edge(0, 1, 4),   new Edge(0, 7, 8),   new Edge(1, 2, 8),   new Edge(1, 7, 11),   new Edge(2, 3, 7),  
//  new Edge(2, 8, 2),   new Edge(2, 5, 4),   new Edge(3, 4, 9),   new Edge(3, 5, 14),   new Edge(4, 5, 10),   new Edge(5, 6, 2),   
// new Edge(6, 7, 1),   new Edge(6, 8, 6),   new Edge(7, 8, 7) in the format of (edge pairs, weights) with a total number of 9 vertices.

// Sample Output: Minimum cost to connect all rooms: 37

// Question 2
// You are an aspiring computer scientist tasked with creating a function that can find the shortest path between two locations in a graph. 
// The graph represents various locations and the roads connecting them, with each road having a specific distance associated with it. 
// Your goal is to create a function called bfsShortestPath (graph, source, target) that takes in the graph, the source node 
// (representing the traveler's current location), and the target node (representing the traveler's destination). 
// The function should return an array representing the shortest path from the source to the target.

// The graph is represented using an adjacency list. 
// This means that each location in the graph is a node, and the roads connecting them are represented as edges. 
// The adjacency list stores the neighboring nodes for each node, allowing you to traverse the graph efficiently. 
// Your task is to create a bfsShortestPath function, utilizing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the source to the target.
//  The function should return an array that represents the shortest path, starting from the source and ending at the target.

// Sample Input: A: ['B', 'C'],   B: ['A', 'D', 'E'],   C: ['A', 'F'],   D: ['B'],   E: ['B', 'F'],   F: ['C', 'E'],

// Question 3
// You are a cab driver in Boston, and you receive a request to pick up a passenger from a specific location. 
// Your task is to find all possible routes to reach the passenger's location using the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm in JavaScript. 
// You need to implement the Depth First Search algorithm to find all possible routes from your current location (the starting node) 
// to the passenger's location (the target node). 
// Your goal is to provide a list of all possible routes. Implement the dfsAllRoutes(graph, source, target) 
// function in JavaScript that takes the graph, the source node (your current location), and the target node (the passenger's location) as input. 
// The function should return an array of all possible routes from the source to the target.

// Sample Input:  A: ["B", "C"],   B: ["A", "D", "E"],   C: ["A", "F"],   D: ["B"],   E: ["B", "F"],   F: ["C", "E"],

// Question 4
// Imagine you are developing a navigation system for a delivery robot that needs to navigate through a city to deliver packages efficiently. 
// The city is represented as a graph, where each point is a location, and the edges between points represent the routes that the robot can take. 
// Each edge has a weight associated with it, representing the distance or time required to travel from one point to another. 
// The goal is to use Dijkstra's algorithm in JavaScript to calculate the shortest path for the robot, optimizing package delivery.

// In this scenario, the graph representing the city is as follows:

// Point A connects to Point B with a weight of 5.

// Point A connects to Point C with a weight of 2.

// Point B connects to Point D with a weight of 4.

// Point B connects to Point E with a weight of 2.
